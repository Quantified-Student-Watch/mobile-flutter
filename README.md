# Quantified Student Watch

In this project we will attempt to predict upcoming stress signals using machine learning and
smartwatches. These predictions can be displayed to user using a mobile application.

This repository contains the source code for the Android application.

## Compatibility

Delta watch requires connection with a specific smartwatch using a pre-defined protocol, this is
defined by the smartwatch itself. We have to implement this protocol for each smartwatch model.
Currently Delta watch supports the following smartwatches:

### E66

The [E66](https://www.smartwatchspecifications.com/devices/bakeey-e66-thermometer-smartband-specs-review/)
is an affordable smartwatch that includes a professional ECG sensor. This makes it perfect for the
delta watch project, as it can provide accurate heart rate data. It also includes a thermometer.
